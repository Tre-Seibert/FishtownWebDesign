The user wants to disable horizontal scroll on the /contract page on mobile phones. I need to look at the contract-template.html file to understand its structure and then modify the CSS to prevent horizontal scrolling on mobile devices.

Let me first read the contract-template.html file to see its structure, and also check the core.css file since it's already open.</details></think>

Looking at the contract-template.html, I can see it uses a dedicated CSS file: `/public/css/contract-template.css`. The page has a `.contract-wrapper` and various contract-related elements. To fix horizontal scrolling on mobile, I need to check the contract-template.css file to see what styles are being applied and then add appropriate overflow rules.

Let me read the contract-template.css file to understand the current styling and see what might be causing horizontal scroll.</details></think>

Let me check the contract-specific CSS file to understand what's causing the horizontal scroll.

I can see the issue. The page doesn't have overflow-x: hidden set on the html or body elements for mobile. This can cause horizontal scrolling when elements extend beyond the viewport width. Let me add the necessary CSS to prevent horizontal scrolling on mobile devices.

I'll add overflow-x: hidden to the html and body elements specifically for mobile, and also ensure the contract-wrapper doesn't cause overflow. I should add this in the contract-template.css file since it's page-specific.</details></think>

I can see the issue. The page doesn't have `overflow-x: hidden` set for mobile devices, which can cause horizontal scrolling. I'll add the fix to the contract-template.css file.

Good, I've added overflow-x: hidden to the html, body, and contract-wrapper for mobile devices. This should prevent horizontal scrolling on the /contract page on mobile phones.</details></think>

Done. I've added `overflow-x: hidden` to the html, body, and `.contract-wrapper` elements for mobile devices (screens 48rem / 768px and below). This will prevent horizontal scrolling on the `/contract` page on mobile phones.
