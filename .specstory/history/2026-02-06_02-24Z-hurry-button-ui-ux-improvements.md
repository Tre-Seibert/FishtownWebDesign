The user is asking me to improve the "In a hurry? Get Onboarded Today!" button that appears on their website. Looking at the screenshot, it's a circular yellow/gold button in the bottom left corner that looks a bit out of place.

Let me first examine the current implementation to understand what we're working with. I need to look at the HTML and CSS for this element.</details></think>

Now I have a good understanding of the current implementation. The button is:
1. A circular floating element in the bottom-left
2. Has a gold/orange gradient
3. Uses "In a hurry? Get Onboarded Today!" text
4. Bounces with an animation
5. Rotated 12 degrees

Looking at the screenshot, it does look a bit amateur - like a sticker or badge that doesn't quite fit the professional aesthetic of the site. The site has a clean, modern design with:
- Clean typography
- Black/white/gold color scheme
- Understated elegance

Let me think about a better approach as a senior UI/UX engineer:

Problems with current design:
1. The circular badge shape feels dated and cheap
2. "In a hurry? Get Onboarded Today!" is awkward phrasing
3. The bouncing animation is distracting
4. Rotated angle makes it feel like a sticker
5. It overlaps content awkwardly
6. Too "busy" compared to the clean aesthetic of the rest of the site

Better approach:
1. A sleek, minimal floating button that matches the site's aesthetic
2. Clear, compelling copy
3. Subtle animation (not bouncy)
4. Professional shape - could be a pill/rounded rectangle
5. Use the brand colors more elegantly

Copy ideas:
- "Start Today" - simple, action-oriented
- "Get Started" - too generic
- "Quick Start" 
- "Book Now"
- "Let's Talk"
- "Schedule Call"
- "Begin Project" 

Looking at the site, they're a web design agency. The button should encourage quick action. Something like:

Option 1: Modern floating pill button
- "Start Your Project" or "Get Started" with an arrow icon
- Clean, dark background with gold accent
- Subtle hover effect

Option 2: Sleek corner badge
- Minimal design that sits in corner
- Could include a small icon
