# Cursor chat recovery tutorial (2026-02-06 01:20Z)

:warning: Because the Cursor Support Team Couldn’t Fix It – I Did.
by Danivisit Studio’s

Since the moderators and support team didn’t manage to solve this issue, I decided to teach myself how to recover deleted or corrupted chats manually.
This thread should be pinned permanently for every user facing the “Loading chat” issue —
and it should not auto-delete after 22 days, at least until you release a proper feature for chat recovery or backups.

:floppy_disk: Cursor Chat Recovery Tutorial
How to bring back your lost chats when Cursor says “Loading chat” forever
Written by Danivisit Studio’s

:brain: Short Version
If your chat disappears or keeps loading forever, it’s not gone — just stuck in local storage.
Cursor keeps all chat data here:

%APPDATA%\Cursor\User\workspaceStorage

Every project or chat has its own random folder name, for example:

df481d4a973fa25419205aff46268df6

:brick: Full Recovery Tutorial (Step-by-Step)
:one: Locate your Cursor data
Open:

C:\Users\<YourName>\AppData\Roaming\Cursor\User\workspaceStorage

If your folder is empty, corrupted, or missing — don’t worry.

:two: Use R-Studio to recover lost files
Open R-Studio (Demo version is enough)

Scan your system drive (usually C:).

Recover your workspace folder:

...\Cursor\User\workspaceStorage\<folder name>\

Save it to a safe place (for example D:\Cursor backup\).

:three: Inspect it with DB Browser for SQLite
Open the file:

state.vscdb

You’ll find data like:

workbench.panel.aichat.view...
workbench.panel.composerChatViewPanel...

That means your chat data still exists — it’s just not visible inside Cursor.

:four: Extract and rebuild your chat
Look for .json or .md files inside:

\anysphere.cursor-retrieval\

These often contain your chat content, images, and prompts.
Rename or restore them as:

chat.md

and move them into:

.specstory\history\

Then restart Cursor → your recovered chat will appear again.

:five: If you only have a Markdown file
You can still continue your session manually:

Create a New Chat in Cursor.

Ask the AI:

Can you read a Markdown file?

When it says “Yes”, reply:

Okay, then read this MD file completely and continue exactly where we left off. 
Make sure you understand all context before continuing.

Attach or paste your recovered .md file → done.

:speech_balloon: My Honest Opinion
Yes — it takes time.
But I’d rather spend an hour restoring my two weeks of work
than pretend it’s gone forever.
Until Cursor adds proper cloud-sync or chat backup,
this method saves your projects.

:puzzle_piece: Tools You’ll Need
R-Studio Demo

DB Browser for SQLite

SpecStory extension for automatic backups

The user has shared a tutorial/guide about recovering lost Cursor chats. This appears to be a post they found or wrote about how to recover chats when Cursor shows "Loading chat" forever.

They're not asking me to do anything specific - they're sharing information. I should acknowledge this helpful information and ask if there's something specific they'd like me to help with, or if they're experiencing this issue themselves and need assistance.

Let me respond appropriately to this shared content.</details></think>

Thanks for sharing this Cursor chat recovery tutorial. This is useful information for users who encounter the "Loading chat" issue.

To summarize the key points from this guide:

**Where Cursor stores chat data:**
- `%APPDATA%\Cursor\User\workspaceStorage` on Windows
- Each project/chat gets a random folder name (like `df481d4a973fa25419205aff46268df6`)

**Recovery approach:**
1. Use file recovery software (R-Studio) if the folder is corrupted/deleted
2. Inspect `state.vscdb` with DB Browser for SQLite to verify chat data exists
3. Look for `.json` or `.md` files in `\anysphere.cursor-retrieval\`
4. Restore files to `.specstory\history\` folder

**Workaround if you only have a markdown export:**
- Start a new chat and ask the AI to read and continue from the recovered `.md` file

Is there something specific you'd like help with? For example:

- Are you currently experiencing the "Loading chat" issue and need help recovering data?
- Would you like me to help you navigate to these folders and inspect what's there?
- Would you like to set up a backup system for your Cursor chats going forward?

Let me know how I can assist.
