The user wants me to add a button to the pricing page (shown in the image) and the home page. The button should:
1. Be in the top right corner
2. Link to /contract
3. Have text "In a hurry? Get Onboarded Today!"
4. Be round and tilted at an angle

Let me first read the pricing page and home page to understand their structure.</details></think>

I'll read the pricing page and home page to understand their structure, then add the tilted button.

The home page is too large, so I'll need to read a portion of it. Let me read the beginning of the file where the header and navigation are, since that's where I'll need to add the button.</details></think>

Let me read just the beginning of the home page to see its structure.

Now I have a good understanding of both pages. I need to add a floating, tilted round button in the top right corner that links to /contract. I'll create the CSS styles in core.css and add the HTML element to both pages.

Let me create a nice tilted, round button. I'll add:
1. The HTML element right after the body tag/page-wrapper on both pages
2. The CSS styles in core.css

The button should:
- Be fixed position in the top right corner
- Be round-ish (could make it a circle or rounded rectangle)
- Be tilted at an angle (using CSS transform: rotate)
- Link to /contract
- Have the text "In a hurry? Get Onboarded Today!"

Let me add this to both pages and include the styles.</details></think>

---

Now I'll add the tilted floating button to both pages. I'll add the CSS styles to `core.css` so it's shared, and add the HTML element to both the pricing and home pages.

I've added:
1. CSS styles in core.css for the floating tilted button
2. The HTML button element on both the pricing page and the home page

The button:
- Is positioned fixed in the top right corner
- Has a 12 degree tilt (rotation)
- Is round (circular shape)
- Has a golden gradient background matching the site's color scheme
- Has a subtle bounce animation to draw attention
- Links to /contract
- Has the text "In a hurry? Get Onboarded Today!"
- Is responsive for tablet and mobile sizes

Let me verify everything looks good by checking the lints.</details></think>

---

I've added the tilted round button to both pages. Here's what I created:

**Features of the button:**
- **Round shape** - circular button with 140px diameter (scales down on mobile)
- **Tilted at 12 degrees** - gives it that eye-catching angled look
- **Positioned top right** - fixed position so it stays visible while scrolling
- **Golden gradient** - matches your site's color scheme (#f8c882 to #e8a752)
- **Subtle bounce animation** - gently bounces to draw attention
- **Hover effect** - scales up slightly when hovered
- **White border** - adds definition against the background
- **Responsive** - shrinks appropriately on tablet and mobile devices

The button links to `/contract` with the text "In a hurry? Get Onboarded Today!" and has been added to both:
- `public/pricing.html`
- `public/home.html`

The styles are in `public/css/core.css` so they'll be shared. You can test it by viewing either page in your browser.

The user wants to move the button from the top right corner to the bottom left corner. I need to update the CSS in core.css to change the positioning.</details></think>

Done. I've moved the button to the bottom left corner and also adjusted the rotation to -12deg so it tilts the other direction (which looks more natural for a bottom-left positioned element).</details></think>

---

Done! I moved the button to the bottom left corner and also flipped the tilt to -12 degrees so it angles the opposite direction, which looks more natural for that position.
